S.H.I.F.T., the "Schedule Handler in an Integrated, Formatted Template", intends to simplify employee schedule management. 
Through the online interface, employees can view their schedule and request shift swaps with their co-workers without sharing other contact information. Simultaneously, supervisors can approve of shift changes, email employees in groups, and view schedules all through the single interface.
